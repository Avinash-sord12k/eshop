converting only client components to server + client components - 22 aug
problems faced: state update was getting delayed, so the ui was not updating properly.
solution: used exact value changed in search function to get the latest value for the search query.

to do:
1. adding password reset page and integrated its api's
2. adding custom 404 page
3. adding custom 500 page
4. adding related category products in products page
5. adding review section in product page
6. adding a filtered search for products


=> Things I have added in the project to make it more efficeint:

1. added prefetch for faster loading of pages
2. added lazy loading for faster loading of pages and images (using Image component and setting priority according to the need)
3. user suspense for better user experience
4. added redux toolkit for better state management
5. added redux persist for persisting the state
6. Used more server components and client componets in lower down the leaves of the dom tree.
7. added dedicated panel, routes, components, role based access control for different roles

shortcuts learned:
shift + num_8 => volume up
shift + num_2 => volume down
f3, f4 => previous, next track
super + L => sleep
cntrl + L => select line
